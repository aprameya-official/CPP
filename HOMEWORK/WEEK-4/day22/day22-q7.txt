"Byte addressable" refers to a memory architecture in which individual bytes (8 bits) within the memory are individually addressable. In a byte-addressable memory system, each byte has a unique memory address, making it possible to read from or write to any individual byte in memory using its specific address.

This contrasts with bit-addressable memory, where the smallest addressable unit is a single bit. In most practical computer systems, memory is organized into bytes or larger units, making byte-addressable memory more common and convenient for tasks like data storage, manipulation, and retrieval.

In byte-addressable memory:

1. Each byte has its own unique address, typically represented as a sequence of binary digits (bits).
2. Data can be stored and retrieved at the granularity of individual bytes.
3. Memory operations, such as reading, writing, and copying, are typically performed on whole bytes.

Byte addressability is a fundamental characteristic of modern computer memory systems, including RAM (Random Access Memory) and storage devices like hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs). It allows for efficient data handling and manipulation in byte-sized chunks, which is essential for most computer programs and data storage applications.
